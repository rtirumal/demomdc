# Route 53 Public Hosted Zones

This Terraform Modules manages public DNS entries using [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). 

For each domain name (e.g. example.com) you pass in, this module will create a [Route 53 Public Hosted 
Zone](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html). The Terraform configurations 
for each app are responsible for adding their individual DNS records (e.g. foo.example.com) to this Hosted Zone.

## How do you use this module?

See the [root README](/) for instructions on using modules.
