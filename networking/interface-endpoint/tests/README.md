# package tests folder

This folder contains one or more tests that can be executed in a non-production AWS account to verify the package functionality.

To use these tests deploy them to the terraform testing account inventory repo and then destroy them.

> See also [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) for more advanced testing capabilities.
