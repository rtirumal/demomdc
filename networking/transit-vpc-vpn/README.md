# Resource Destroy and Re-Create Terraform Bug
- There is a bug with Terraform that applies to this package. Any time the pre-shared key is set in a vpn connection the terraform will always try to destroy and re-create the connection.  If applied it will destroy the connection , re-cretae it and you will again have to work with the GCO team to re-establish it.  This is a terrble situation.  Therefore, after applying the package to your VPC if you need to make a change simply comment out the pre-shared key lines in each vpn connection resource before applying.  The values are needed when first creating the connection, but not needed if updating anything else inside of the package besides the actual pre-shared keys themselves.  This is not a very elegant workaround, but the only existing workaround at this time, until they hopefully fix this issue.  Though the defect has been around since they first supported providing the pre-shared keys.
